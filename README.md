# clarm-cli
Alarm app for the bash command line

Nowhere near finished (use "--help" to see what you can do with it!)
Feel free to contact me with suggestions or issues

## Installation:
1. Install the dependencies via apt
  - at
  - mplayer
  - amixer
3. copy the files to a folder anywhere in your computer
4. add the folder to your path ( [If you don't know how to do that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix) )

## Changing the alarm sound
Any sound file with the name "alarm.wav" that replaces the stock alarm sound in the same folder should work with the script
